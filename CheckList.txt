📌 Notes
	•	This checklist combines development, networking, consensus, testing, and deployment readiness into a coherent GitHub‑friendly task list you can track in issues or projects.
	•	Using GitHub task lists with CI (GitHub Actions) helps ensure that PRs cannot be merged until all relevant checks are green.
	•	A template like this guides developers and operations teams through launch readiness and deployment phases.  ￼
